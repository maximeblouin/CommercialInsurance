    \brief      No source code - only file grouping for program documentation

    \details    This file does not contain any source code. Its purpose is to
                define groups to be used in SASUnit's program documentation.
                The group structure is being defined by defgroup and ingroup
                instructions above. Defined groups may be used with an ingroup
                instruction in other source code files.
